        Forget about <i>big data</i>, <i>deep learning</i> and <i>smart electrons!</i>
      </h3>

      <p>
        Too many companies spend too much money on hiring people to introduce data-related buzz-words into their business.
        In fact, most companies do not have big data and most likely they do not need deep learning. 
        Our ambition is to give proper and useful advice that does not just rely on knowledge of data science, but also on how it 
        relates to business problems.

        The Deal
      </h3>

      <p>
        You should not give away a large amount of equity for advice, and we do not want to give away
        a lot of our time for nothing. We are basing our pricing model on 
        the <a href="https://fi.co/contents/fast#">Founder Advisor 
        Standard Template</a>, which we think is a fair model:

        We have worked and advised on data science and machine learning for a large number of companies, for example Mærsk, eBay and CERN. 
        We are experienced software developers, machine learning researchers and business developers. Our networks contain a large number 
        of data scientists that we can connect you to.
